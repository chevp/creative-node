# Creative Node

Creative Node is a powerful multi-stack application built with Node.js, JavaScript, and TypeScript. It serves as both a usage platform and a playground for experimenting with generative AI technologies. This versatile tool empowers developers, researchers, and enthusiasts to explore, prototype, and deploy generative AI models seamlessly.

## Features

- **Multi-Stack Integration**: Combines the flexibility of JavaScript with the robustness of TypeScript.
- **Generative AI Playground**: Experiment with various generative AI models and frameworks.
- **Customizable Modules**: Easily add and modify AI functionalities to suit specific use cases.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built to handle diverse workloads from rapid prototyping to deployment.
- **Interactive UI**: Offers an intuitive interface for visualizing AI outputs and debugging.
